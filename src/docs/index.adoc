Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Product Management Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing products in {gr8crm} applications. A product is an item that you
sell or have in your inventory. A product have properties like identification number, name, description and product group.
The following features are supported by the +crm-product+ plugin.

- Multiple prices, specified by price lists
- Product compositions (includes, replaces, equivalent, etc.)
- Attachments (images, brochures) if combined with the +crm-content+ plugin
- Reference to product suppliers if combined with the +crm-contact+ plugin

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-product-ui/[crm-product-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface
for managing products and price lists. +crm-product-ui+ depends on +crm-product+ so you only need to include +crm-product-ui+
in your BuildConfig.groovy if you want end-user product management features.
