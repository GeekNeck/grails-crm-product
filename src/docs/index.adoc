== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Product Management Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing products in {gr8crm} applications. A product is an item that you
sell or have in your inventory. A product have properties like identification number, name, description and product group.
The following features are supported by the +crm-product+ plugin.

- Multiple prices, specified by price lists
- Staggered prices
- Product compositions (includes, replaces, equivalent, etc.)
- Attachments (images, brochures) if combined with the +crm-content+ plugin
- Reference to product suppliers if combined with the +crm-contact+ plugin

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-product-ui/[crm-product-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface
for managing products and price lists. +crm-product-ui+ depends on +crm-product+ so you only need to include +crm-product-ui+
in your BuildConfig.groovy if you want end-user product management features.

== CrmProductService

Like most other {gr8crm} plugins this plugin have a main service with methods for creating, searching and updating products.

=== Create a new product

+CrmProduct createProduct(Map params, boolean save = false)+

To create a product you call the createProduct method with a map of property values.

[source,groovy]
.CreateUsbCable.groovy
----
def hardware = crmProductService.createProductGroup(name: "Hardware", true)
def std = crmProductService.createPriceList(param: 'standard', name: 'Standard price list', true)
def product = crmProductService.createProduct(number: "USB18", name: "USB Cable 1.8 meter", group: hardware, true)
product.addToPrices(priceList: std, unit: 'pcs', outPrice: 6.99, vat: 0.20)
println "The price for $product is €${product.price} excl. VAT"
----

=== Search for products

As usual in {gr8crm} plugins the main service has a +list()+ method that performs a query.

TIP: The +list()+ method is +@Selectable+ which means you can use the +selection+ plugin to query for products.

+def list(Map query, Map params)+

To search for products you initialize the +query+ map with query values. With the +params+ map you can specify things like
sort order and pagination. The following query keys can be used in the +query+ map.

|===
| Key             | Description            | Type
| number          | Product number         | String (wildcard supported)
| name            | Product name           | String (wildcard supported)
| group           | Product group          | String (wildcard supported)
| supplier        | Name of supplier       | String (wildcard supported)
| suppliersNumber | Supplier's item number | String (wildcard supported)
| barcode         | Bar code               | String (wildcard supported)
| customsCode     | Customs code           | String (wildcard supported)
| weight          | Weight                 | Double
| price           | Product price          | Double
| enabled         | Enabled/disabled       | boolean
|===

The following example will find all enabled products in the *hardware* product group that has *usb* in the product name.
As you can see you can combine several query values when you search for domain instances.

[source,groovy]
.FindUsbProducts.groovy
----
def result = crmProductService.list([group: 'hardware', name: '*usb*', enabled: true], [:])
println "Found ${result.size()} USB products"
----
